/*
  ADMINISTRATIVE USERNAME/PASSWORD
  Set username/password here for initial install. For security you can remove these entries if you
  wish to prevent them from being used. Or comment them out. If you need to enter the system
  again later as the administrative user, uncomment or re-create.

  You can also remove the 'access.php' file completely for further security.

  Ideal for developers to set up the system.

  NOTE. You must create additional staff in the admin area before removing this file or data in this file
  or else you will not be able to access the system. If this happens, replace this file.
