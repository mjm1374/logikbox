Maddening. I have been refining my site over the last few months I’ve added a great deal of features and data. Toss in a few API’s and their mixed and matched data, things were beginning to getting sloppy. Doing a code review I noticed I was doing the same thing in 4 separate files to format dates from different sources. My first thought was to standardize the process in a function and use that as date format controller.  While planning I opted to make it a module so I could use it on other projects and if I update it one place I can update it everywhere with npm. What started as a basic formatter, then grew into a standards converter and finally a full blown free form pattern mapping Time/Date formatting tool. Supporting Unix timestamps, ISO and UTC time stamps you can imput any combo and be returned in an object with multiple values in dozens of formats to use as you need. You can also use the prebuilt filters for quick standardized formats and you can even add your own masks and receive back the format of your choosing. It is available on NPM, just look for lbx-tardis.</p></span>", "tardis100.png","tardis.webp","https://www.npmjs.com/package/lbx-tardis"),

We wrote our own game engine to update all the pieces and check for collisions. We got lucky and found the original <a href='http://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/asteroids/sounds' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>game sounds</a> on line. Updated the styles to make it a little more colorful.

We hammered this one out in a weekend, they learned the hard lessons of dirty data and how to clean it. You should have seen their faces when I made them sit down in front of Excel and go through our downloaded data. We located some resources on line to get <a href='http://www.n2yo.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>satellite data</a> via ajax. Though we were only able to get 300 secs of flight data at a time we made it work. Leveraging Google maps and few open API’s we were able to construct a tracker of most of the known orbital bodies flying over head.

The app was location aware, we developed a light Restful API to talk to Mural Arts DB and tied it into Google Maps api for directions. The data was sketchy, so we create a way for user to take and submit photo’s to update the database. They could even report damage.
